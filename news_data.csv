"What’s so special about orange cats? Turns out they’re freaks of nature","Fri May 23 18:59:54 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/science/orange-cats-genetic-mutation","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-142832910.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.  A new study may have uncovered exactly what makes orange cats special — though it might not be for the reason you think.  Ginger kitties are known among cat owners for being particularly friendly and feisty. To geneticists, however, the uniqueness of these house cats comes from the unusual way they get their color. Now, scientists say they have unraveled a longstanding mystery by identifying the specific DNA mutation responsible for that golden hue — and the variant has not been found in any other animal.  The genetic variant is described for the first time in a paper published May 15 in the journal Current Biology.  “This is a really unusual type of mutation,” said lead study author Christopher Kaelin, a senior scientist in genetics at Stanford University in California.  The vast majority of fully orange cats are male, which led scientists to reason decades ago that the genetic code for orange color is carried on the X chromosome. As with other mammals, female cats have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y. Any male cat carrying the orange trait on its one X chromosome will be entirely orange. A female would need to inherit the trait on both X chromosomes (one from each of her parents) to be completely orange, which makes it less likely. Instead, most female cats with orange fur have patchy patterns — calico or tortoiseshell — that may include black and white.  Related article Rare photos give a glimpse into the lives of wild cats in Malaysia’s tropical jungles  But where the mutation exists on the X chromosome, and how it gives rise to orange coloration, has been an enigma until now. Typically, mutations that lead to yellow or orange fur in animals (and red hair in humans) occur within genes that control for color. And those genes aren’t carried on the X chromosome. “That suggested to us that by identifying the molecular cause, we might learn something new and interesting, which turned out to be the case,” said senior study author Greg Barsh, a professor emeritus of genetics and pediatrics at Stanford.  The findings not only elucidated the peculiar origins of some cats’ charismatic coloration, but also revealed new insights about a familiar gene.  Step one was to identify genetic mutations that are unique to orange cats and might give rise to their color. For a decade, Kaelin has frequented cat shows, asking owners of ginger-colored cats if he could take samples of the animals’ DNA with a cheek swab. (He’s also interested in patterns that are similar to those found in wild cats such as leopards and ocelots, which are common in popular breeds like Bengal cats and Toygers.)  Comparing his collection of DNA with feline genomes that have been sequenced in the past five to 10 years, he and his research team found 51 genetic variations on the X chromosome that were shared by orange males. But 48 were also found in non-orange cats, which left three likely candidates for the elusive mutation.  One was a small, 5,076-base pair deletion that removed about 0.005% of the X chromosome in a region that didn’t appear to code for a particular protein. The deletion wasn’t located within a gene, where mutations usually are found. However, the mutation lay between two sites associated with a nearby gene called Arhgap36, which regulates an important hormone signaling pathway used by nearly all mammalian cells and tissues. There was no known connection to pigmentation. The gene isn’t even turned on in pigment-producing cells.  To find out how the gene affects color, Kaelin studied its actions in live tissues collected at spay and neuter clinics that otherwise would have been discarded. The experiments showed that, somehow, the deletion activates Arhgap36 in pigment cells, where it blocks production of black pigment so the cells produce orange instead.  The variant has not been found in other animals, including the wild cats that gave rise to domestic cats.  Related article Kazakhstan’s last tigers disappeared decades ago. Now, they’re coming back  “It’s a genetic exception that was noticed over a hundred years ago,” Kaelin said in a news release by Stanford University. “It’s really that comparative genetic puzzle that motivated our interest in sex-linked orange.”  That singularity suggests the mutation probably occurred once during domestication and then was selectively bred for, Kaelin said. “We see the same mutation in all orange cats that we’ve looked at over a wide geographic area, so there’s a single mutation that occurred,” he said. “And we know that mutation is quite old because there are depictions of calico cats in Chinese art that dates to the 12th century.” He added that specialists in prehistoric DNA might be able to use the new findings to pinpoint when and where the mutation originally arose.  “The variants identified could serve as valuable tools in population genetics to trace domestic feline evolutionary history,” said Hannes Lohi, a professor of veterinary biosciences and genetics at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Lohi was not involved in the study.  In the meantime, Kaelin and his collaborators want to figure out how a small deletion that’s not itself within a gene can change the activity of a nearby gene.  “The goal is, sure, that we’ll learn about the mutation,” Barsh noted, “but we also want to learn more about mutational mechanisms in general: Why is this so unusual and might the same mechanism occur in other genes that cause other phenotypes in other animals?” He pointed out that there are many conditions in humans that are thought to be genetic, but for which no genetic mutation has been identified. Maybe, he posits, the problem isn’t just that we haven’t located the mutations, but that we don’t understand all the ways that mutations can cause disease traits in the first place.  Related article 35,000-year-old saber-toothed baby cat mummy still has its fur  And could orange cats’ unusual genetics possibly explain their particular personalities? So far, Kaelin says he and his colleagues have no reason to think so, though other researchers could make use of the new study’s findings to look for associations between behavior and coat color. “I think orange cats have really convinced their owners that they’re different, but they’ve yet to convince us,” he said.

"Ringleader in Kardashian robbery plot found guilty by Paris court","Fri May 23 18:25:32 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/world/kim-kardashian-trial-verdict-latam-intl","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-05-13t170957z-341388957-rc24heavqbh3-rtrmadp-3-people-kim-kardashian.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Eight people behind the 2016 multimillion-dollar armed robbery of reality TV star Kim Kardashian in her rental apartment in Paris were found guilty Friday, with some sentenced to prison, after a weekslong trial.  The alleged ringleader of the group – nicknamed the “Grandpa robbers” for the advanced age of several of the accused – Aomar Aït Khedache was sentenced to eight years in prison, five of which were suspended.  Seven of his co-defendants were also found guilty of crimes including robbery in an organized gang, kidnapping, sequestration, acquisition and possession of weapons, assisting an armed gang, aggravated theft, and complicity in preparation of a criminal act.  Most of them also received prison sentences, portions of which were suspended, but all will walk free due to time already served.  Two other defendants were acquitted on charges of complicity, though one was ordered to pay 5,000 euros ($5,682) to the civil parties in the trial, including Kardashian and the concierge of the rental apartment building.  Related article Kim Kardashian is now a law school graduate  “The sentences are quite lenient; they were thought of a long way away from this serious event, which impacted the civil parties. You have caused harm, even if you did not strike, if blood has not been shed, you have caused fear,” said the presiding judge David De Pas as he handed down the verdict.  In a statement released after the trial, Kardashian said she was “deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case.”  “The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. While I’ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system,” Kardashian said.  Her legal team said, “Kim appreciates the court’s decision and once again thanks the French authorities for treating her with great respect throughout the process. It has been a long journey from that terrible night back in 2016 to her standing courageously in a historic Paris courtroom to confront these criminals. She looks forward to putting this tragic episode behind her, as she continues working to improve the criminal justice system on behalf of victims, the innocent, and the incarcerated seeking to redeem themselves.”  The lawyer for Yunice Abbas, one of the defendants who was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison, with five suspended, also welcomed the verdict.  “It’s a very fair decision, it’s a very just decision. (Abbas) is very happy to be back with his family tonight. We’re very happy with this decision,” said the lawyer Gabriel Dumenil.  Earlier in the trial, the court had heard from Kardashian that she “absolutely thought” her assailants would kill her. She also recalled fearing rape, as the men manhandled her in the robe she was sleeping in when the armed men burst in.  Related article Kim Kardashian and the checkered history of celebrity courtroom dressing  “I have babies, I have to make it home, I have babies,” Kardashian recalled pleading with the armed men, who had broken into her hotel room while she slept during Paris Fashion Week in 2016.  Kardashian was mostly calm during her testimony but was on occasions reduced to tears as she described how the burglary had upended her life and changed how she organizes her security.  Of the original 12 suspects, one has since died, and another defendant who has Alzheimer’s disease has been ruled unfit to stand trial.  Toward the end of Kardashian’s testimony, the presiding judge read her a letter from Khedache, the ringleader of the group, apologizing for the trauma he had inflicted. Although he was in the courtroom, the 68-year-old Khedache is partially deaf and unable to speak, his lawyer told CNN before the hearing.  “I want to come to you as a human being and say how much I regret my act,” he wrote.  Visibly moved, Kardashian said in her testimony she forgave him, “but it doesn’t change the emotion and the feelings and the trauma.”  This is a developing story and will be updated."
"Several people sustain ‘life-threatening’ injuries in knife attack at Hamburg’s Central Station, police say","Fri May 23 17:59:43 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/europe/knife-attack-hamburg-central-station-latam-intl","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2215943744.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Eighteen people were injured, four critically, in a knife attack Friday in the German city of Hamburg, authorities said.  Hamburg police said they have arrested a 39-year-old German woman, who they believe acted alone in carrying out the attack at the city’s Central Station, after a major police operation. She is in police custody and expected to be brought to a court on Saturday, police said.  Seven people were “badly injured,” while seven others were “lightly injured,” police said. The victims are aged between 19 and 85 years old.  The four critically injured, who include a 24-year-old female, 24-year-old male, 52-year-old female and 85-year-old female, are in a stabilized condition, police said in an update on Saturday.  Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Police said there was “concrete” evidence that the suspect suffers from a mental illness.  In a statement late on Friday, Hamburg police said the attacker had acted “apparently indiscriminately, stabbed passersby, injuring some of them critically.”  Related article Two killed, 11 injured after car rams crowd in German city of Mannheim  Video footage from the scene filmed by CNN’s affiliate RTL Germany shows people in forensic suits inspecting the area while police gather in the train station.  Following the attack, Germany’s Friedrich Merz thanked the city’s emergency responders for their assistance and said that his “thoughts are with the victims and their families,” according to federal government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius.  Federal Minister of the Interior Alexander Dobrindt also said his thoughts were with the victims and thanked the emergency services. “It is shocking when travelers are attacked in a treacherous and cowardly manner,” Dobrindt said.  Hamburg’s Central Station is the busiest passenger railway station in Germany, with more than 550,000 travelers per day, according to the city’s website.  Germany has faced rising rates of knife crime in recent years, with some incidents stirring up tensions over migration ahead of parliamentary elections in February.  Some in the country were concerned by a series of high-profile attacks allegedly carried out by asylum seekers or migrants.  In January, a 28-year-old man from Afghanistan was arrested following a knife attack in the German city of Aschaffenburg in which two people were killed, including a toddler.  Last year, a Syrian man turned himself in and confessed to stabbing to death three people and wounding several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.

"Billy Joel cancels upcoming tour due to neurological disorder","Fri May 23 17:17:45 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/entertainment/billy-joel-tour-canceled-nph-brain-disorder","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2183985002.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Billy Joel’s upcoming tour dates have been canceled as the legendary performer seeks treatment for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition that affects the brain, according to a statement released on said Friday.  The statement, posted on his Instagram page Friday, stated that Joel’s condition “has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance.”  “Under his doctor’s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period,” the statement read. “Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”  The statement added that Joel “looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage.”  CNN has reached out to Joel for further comment.  The singer was quoted in the statement, saying he was “sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience.”  Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus is a “very rare condition” that “occurs when a person has too much fluid in the brain,” according to Yale Medicine. Fewer than 3% of adults over the age of 65 are diagnosed with NPH and it affects men and women equally.  It was previously announced in March that Joel was postponing eight tour dates so that he could focus on recovering from recent surgery. A statement posted to his Instagram page at the time that he was set to “undergo physical therapy under the supervision of his doctors.”  “While I regret postponing any shows, my health must come first. I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans,” Joel wrote, adding that he was “expected to make a full recovery” from the undisclosed medical condition.  The “Piano Man” singer on Friday announced that he was canceling 17 dates total, including the eight rescheduled shows.  Joel’s statement notified ticket holders that they will be automatically refunded the cost of their tickets."
"Ukraine and Russia begin large-scale prisoner exchange, source says","Fri May 23 11:08:05 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/europe/ukraine-and-russia-biggest-prisoner-exchange-war-intl","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2214733850.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Russia and Ukraine have completed the first phase of what is expected to be the biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war, with almost 800 people released on Friday.  The swap started on Friday and will continue on Saturday and Sunday, with Kyiv and Moscow expected to swap 2,000 people – 1,000 from each side.  The agreement to release 1,000 prisoners on each side was the only significant outcome of the meeting between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul last week, which marked the first time the two sides have met directly since soon after Russia’s full-scale unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  “We are bringing our people home,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X, adding that 390 people arrived back to Ukraine on Friday. He said the group included 270 military and 120 civilians.  The Ukrainian Coordination Center for Treatment of Prisoners of War said three women and 387 men were among those released on Friday.  The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement that “270 Russian servicemen and 120 civilians” were returned to Russia. It said the civilians were captured by Ukrainian troops in Kursk, the Russian region to which Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last summer. Russia has since reclaimed most of the territory.  However, Zelensky said later that the Russian civilians returned by Ukraine were “Russian saboteurs and collaborators” who were arrested by Ukrainian law enforcement officers.  As in previous exchanges, the released prisoners were brought to a meeting place in several buses after being released by Russia at the Ukrainian border. Many were given Ukrainian flags and bracelets in Ukrainian colours at the border.  Photos and videos released by the Ukrainian government showed dozens of men wearing military fatigues, most of them with their heads shaved, posing wrapped in flags.  Several of the released men could be seen speaking to their loved ones over the phone, some breaking into tears as they hear the voices on the other side.  One video showed people from villages along the route of the convoy coming out with flags, greeting the returnees.  “I feel joy because I’m home, that’s all. I’m happy for you, for us, that we came… we prayed and asked for this to happen,” Vasyl Gulyach, who spent two and a half years in captivity, told CNN.  CNN also spoke to Anton Kobylnyk, a 29-year-old who spent over three years in captivity. “I am yours, I received your letter,” he told his girlfriend Yulia on the phone. “What you have done, waiting for me for these 37 months, is a very great feat on your part and an invaluable contribution to our relationship,” he told her.  At the same time, Russian soldiers who have been taken prisoner by Ukraine were handed over to Russian authorities at the border.  On the Ukrainian side, dozens of people waited for hours to greet the returnees at a meeting place in Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, many hoping to see their family members among those being brought back.  Many brought Ukrainian flags and photographs of their loved ones – in case any of the returnees would recognize them and give them information about their whereabouts.  As they waited, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine, indicating that a Russian attack could be imminent.  Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been snatched by Russian authorities in occupied Ukraine and deported into Russia where they have been held without charge or trial.  Their status is complicated – because they have been detained illegally, Ukraine sees them as civilian hostages. Russia has, in some cases, claimed that they should be recognized as prisoners of war – something Kyiv has been reluctant to do because it could put civilians living in occupied areas of Ukraine at risk of being arbitrarily detained.  Ukrainian and Russian authorities were not expected to publicly state that it was taking place until after it had been completed. However, US President Donald Trump broke that convention on Friday, announcing the swap on social media as it was unfolding.  The Istanbul meeting was initially proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to a ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyiv’s European allies – which many saw as a clear attempt by the Kremlin leader to distract and delay.  But while the return of hundreds of Ukrainian detainees will come as a huge relief to their families and loved ones, it remains somewhat underwhelming as the only tangible outcome of the highly touted meeting.  Related video Putin’s visit to Kursk is critical to understand his narrative of the war. Here’s why  In his daily address, Zelensky said Friday’s prisoner exchange was the “only significant result” of last week’s meeting in Turkey, adding that Russia was blocking “everything else.”  Prisoner swaps have been happening regularly, most recently earlier this month.  The Ukrainian Coordination Center for Treatment of Prisoners of War said the exchange on May 7, which saw more than 200 Ukrainian service members return home, was the fifth swap this year and the 64th since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion.  The department said at the time that at 4,757 Ukrainian citizens have been released since March 2022.  Ukraine and its allies demanded that Russia agree to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Istanbul, but that did not happen.  Kyiv also offered direct talks between Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin."
"Twin 19-year-olds were found dead on a remote Georgia mountaintop. Police now say they’ve solved the mystery","Fri May 23 10:00:51 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/us/qaadir-naazir-lewis-georgia-deaths-cec","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/l1000886.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","EDITOR’S NOTE: Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters. In the US, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.  Qaadir and Naazir Lewis entered the world five minutes apart. The identical twins loved many of the same things: anime, the color red and the animated Disney classic, “The Princess and the Frog.” Where one went, the other followed.  Their relatives in suburban Atlanta nicknamed them the “ding-dong twins” because they moved as one. “They were so bound together … like ‘ding-dong, ding-dong,’” said one of their aunts, Sabriya Brawner, mimicking the chime of a doorbell.  The 19-year-olds had big plans for the future, including a cruise to celebrate their 20th birthdays and dreams of becoming entrepreneurs. So their family was stunned when the twins were found shot to death March 8 at the summit of remote Bell Mountain, about a two-hour drive north of Atlanta.  Investigators at the time said preliminary evidence suggested a murder-suicide — an outcome their family members refused to believe.  “The twins would not have harmed each other. They had a strong bond,” their aunt Yasmine Brawner said on Facebook in April. “Someone took their lives away.”  But on Wednesday, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation released a sobering new finding, based on autopsies and other evidence: The twins both died by suicide. Investigators said forensic evidence from the scene showed that both twins had fired a gun. In addition, their phones’ internet history showed searches related to suicide and how to load a gun.  The GBI declined to comment further. The brothers’ family members did not respond Thursday to CNN’s request for comment. But in a statement posted on Facebook, the family disputed the GBI’s conclusion.  “We still have questions regarding (their) investigative findings and feel like (their) final ruling was rushed and closed too soon,” said the statement on Yasmine Brawner’s page. The twins had plans for the future and did not own a weapon, the statement said.  In interviews before this week, the family told CNN the shocking deaths of Qaadir and Naazir have left them struggling to understand what happened. And the new GBI report still leaves many questions unanswered. especially this one: What would lead two ambitious, promising young men to take their own lives?  On March 7 – the day before the discovery of the bodies – Naazir was supposed to fly to Boston to visit his girlfriend, his family said.  Records show that Naazir had a ticket and went to the Atlanta airport but never boarded the plane, the GBI said. The family said they spoke to his girlfriend in Massachusetts, who told them he missed his flight and had rescheduled it for 7 a.m. on March 8 – the day he was found dead.  Much of what happened after that remains unknown. The twins’ stepmother told other family members she briefly saw the brothers later that day at their home in the Atlanta suburb of Lawrenceville, where they lived with her and their dad.  The twins typically shuttled around in a 2009 black Nissan Altima they jointly bought two years ago. The car, and their cell phones, revealed glimpses into their final hours.  The GBI said investigators used cellphone location data to build a timeline of the twins’ journey to Bell Mountain, then checked security video footage along the route to determine the brothers were alone. The family urged the GBI to publicly release those videos.  A spokesperson for the GBI, Nelly Miles, declined to provide additional details, pending the official closing of the investigation in the coming weeks.  One clue of the twins’ final hours came from a Shell station about 10 minutes from the brothers’ house.  The twins stopped at the gas station on the night of March 7, where they bought water, chips and Jack Link’s beef jerky. The snacks cost $10.24. The gas station receipt said it was 10:24 p.m.  The Shell station attendant on duty that night told CNN he does not remember the twins. But assistant manager Chris Allemand said that although he was not working that night, he watched the surveillance video footage of their snack stop before giving it to the GBI about two weeks after their deaths.  One moment on the video stood out, he said. The twins had stopped at pump No. 8, and as they opened their car door, a basketball bounced out onto the concrete before one of them retrieved it — a fleeting glimpse of teenage normalcy before tragedy struck.  After they got their snacks, the brothers climbed into their car and vanished into the night. About 12 hours later, hikers discovered their bodies at the top of the mountain.  Naazir and Qaadir shared the same room most of their lives. They spent hours playing their favorite video game, “Mortal Kombat,” and watching anime. They couldn’t get enough of the “Tokyo Ghoul” and “Attack on Titan” anime series.  Growing up, they would often storm into their sister’s room at the end of the day. Kai’ree Powell is older by six years, but they treated her like their little sister, she said.  “They never let me go into the store alone,” Powell said. “And after school, they would bust into my room and just start talking about their day and ask me about mine.”  Her voice trailed off as her eyes welled up. “They used to get on my dang nerves,” she added softly.  But the siblings were close. Even after Powell moved into her own place, the twins stopped by every week. They plopped onto the couch, scrolled through Netflix and talked about anything and everything, she said.  Their visits continued right until the end.  On March 5, ammunition for the gun was delivered to the house where the brothers lived, the GBI said. Investigators said Naazir – the older twin – had purchased the bullets.  On March 6, the day before Naazir’s planned trip to Boston, the twins spent much of the day with Powell. They accompanied her on a campus tour of the Interactive College of Technology in Chamblee, another Atlanta suburb.  They hung out again that evening at Powell’s place in Atlanta, where they watched the animated sitcom “Rick and Morty” before calling it a night around 11.  In their conversations that night, Powell said her brothers wanted to know what she really wanted to do with her life.  “They asked me … ‘If you didn’t have any anxiety and fears, what would you do?’ And I told them that I would want to dance because I’ve always wanted to be a dancer,” Powell said, her eyes shimmering with tears behind her glasses.  “And they said, ‘You should do that. I really hope that you do that.’ And that was the last thing they said to me.”  When the boys were young, some relatives could barely tell them apart.  But as they grew older, the family noticed small differences. Naazir had wider eyes, said Yasmine Brawner, who babysat them as children. He was also more outspoken and louder than his brother.  As kids they dressed alike. But as teens they opted for different hairstyles, making it easier to tell who was who. Qaadir preferred twists, while Naazir wore braids or a buzz cut.  The twins graduated from Collins Hill High School in Suwanee, Georgia, in May 2023 and were both pursuing their passions at trade schools.  And like their eyes and hairstyles, their goals had subtle differences.  Qaadir attended an aviation maintenance school and wanted to work on airplanes, while Naazir was studying automotive repair at a technical college.  “Qaadir was like, ‘Naazir is fixing cars, I’ll fix airplanes,’” said their aunt, Sabriya Brawner. “Naazir would work on the Nissan because it would break down all the time.”  Their ultimate goal was to be entrepreneurs because they had no interest in working for anyone, their aunts said. They were discussing plans to start an athletic clothing line called Overkill – a name they associated with excellence.  “Like strive for your future, and don’t just stop there. Overkill. Go for it. Go all the way,” Sabriya Brawner said.  They also watched a lot of motivational videos on their phones.  “They were not bare-minimum people. They were so career driven,” Powell said.  Their uncle chuckled as he recalled a time he tried to trick Naazir.  “When he first saw my Jeep, I kind of lied to him that this is the highest engine – the 395. He was like, ‘bruh, no, it’s not,’” Rahim Brawner said. “He knew cars.”  On April 27, three aunts and an uncle – all siblings of the twins’ biological mom – made a road trip from suburban Atlanta up into the mountains of north Georgia.  Unfamiliar with the area, they looked it up before their drive that Sunday morning. They also took the uncle’s Jeep to help navigate the winding road up Bell Mountain, near the border with North Carolina.  “We wanted to travel the same path they did just to try and figure out that scenario,” said their uncle, Rahim Brawner. “I drive a Jeep, and it was hard to get to that mountain. The twins hated long drives … they could barely drive. This is so out of character for them.”  At the park entrance, they stopped at a yellow barricade, near where they believe the Nissan Altima was found. Then they drove the short distance to the summit, past a sign that read, “WARNING STEEP GRADE.”  The top of the mountain contains jagged rocks – some covered in graffiti – and wooden stairs to a platform offering a panoramic view of Lake Chatuge and the Appalachian Mountains. The foursome – Sabriya, Samira, Yasmine and Rahim Brawner – climbed out of the car and walked around.  The family was baffled by the timeline that night. The barricade to the park atop the mountain is supposed to be locked every night from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. So if the twins didn’t leave the Lawrenceville gas station until after 10:24 p.m., when did they reach the mountain? And how did they get past the gate?  “It just doesn’t make sense,” their uncle said, referring to the remote location. “Too sketchy for them.”  A woman who answered the door at the house earlier this month and identified herself as their stepmother, Kaarini Lewis, told CNN that she and her husband – the twins’ father – are still processing the loss. She declined to comment further.  The brothers’ biological mother is also struggling, said Sabriya Brawner, the twins’ aunt. Their mother, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, declined to comment when CNN reached out to her through her siblings.  “For a lot of our family, it’s too much,” Brawner said. “They are extremely traumatized.”  Family members have spent the last few months trying to untangle the mystery of the twins’ final days — and how they ended up at Bell Mountain, of all places.  Seeking answers, they started a GoFundMe in March in the hopes of hiring a private investigator who specializes in homicide and criminal cases.  The many unanswered questions on what led to the twins’ deaths have only deepened family members’ grief.  In their recent statement, the family said Naazir’s girlfriend told them that Naazir didn’t seem depressed and that the two of them were planning a future together and had discussed marriage. Qaadir was pursuing his studies and a dream of owning his own business, the family said.  “The twins were not suicidal,” the statement said.  The brothers were laid to rest on March 28, in matching coffins at a cemetery in suburban Atlanta. They came into the world together, and they left it together.  They had hoped to go on a tropical cruise from Florida to mark their birthdays in April but were still going back-and-forth about the destination in their family group chat, said Shania Brawner, a cousin.  Family members say they still want to plan a cruise trip to heal together and to honor Qaadir and Naazir.  Powell, their sister, told CNN she hopes people will remember her brothers not for how they died, but because of how they lived.  On April 5, the day the brothers would have turned 20, the family got together again at the twins’ mom’s house in Decatur, Georgia, for a posthumous birthday celebration.  They gathered around a cake adorned with the twins’ photos surrounded by wavy white frosting. Foil trays brimmed with the brothers’ favorite food: chicken wings.  People embraced. Some wiped away tears.  “It was our way of keeping them with us, keeping it a happy moment even with everything going on,” Shania Brawner said.  And they released white balloons into the sky, shouting, “Happy heavenly birthday to Qaadir and Naazir!” as they watched them float away, higher and higher, towards the heavens."

"A fifth suspect has been arrested for allegedly helping fugitives who escaped from a New Orleans jail","Fri May 23 04:06:04 EEST 2025","CNN","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/us/new-orleans-jailbreak-third-arrest-hnk","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21630896-101528-still-20250521212142753.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","Authorities have arrested a seventh person in connection with the escape of 10 inmates from a Louisiana jail, according to the New Orleans Police Department.  Emmitt Weber, 28, faces a charge of accessory after the fact of simple escape, police announced in a Friday evening news release.  Earlier in the day, Trevon Williams, already in jail on unrelated charges, was arrested and rebooked facing an additional charge of principal to simple escape, according to an X post from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.  “As I promised when we initiated our investigation, we will hold absolutely everyone who contributed any role to the prison break in New Orleans accountable,” she said.  Williams’ arrest followed five others. Earlier on Friday, New Orleans police announced the arrest of Casey Smith, who is accused of helping two fugitives. The 30-year-old was taken into custody Thursday in the Third District of the city.  “Smith admitted to her role in aiding the escapees’ transport along with Cortnie Harris,” who was arrested Wednesday in connection with the incident, New Orleans police said.  A third suspect, Corvanntay Baptiste, was arrested earlier this week, accused of communicating with escapee Corey Boyd via phone and social media and helping him get food, Louisiana State Police said.  Faulty locks, stolen blankets and a hungry jail employee: A timeline of how 10 inmates used skill and luck to escape  Another arrestee, Connie Weeden, is accused of sending cash via a cell phone app to escapee Jermaine Donald. Weeden, 59, was arrested in Slidell, about 30 miles northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana State Police said.  Besides sending cash, Weeden was in contact with Donald by phone both before and after the escape, state police said. She faces one felony count of accessory after the fact, which carries the possibility of a fine up to $500 and up to five years in prison, authorities said.  And Sterling Williams, a maintenance worker at the jail, was arrested on suspicion of helping the inmates escape by turning off the water to the cell where the inmates disconnected some of the plumbing to escape.  The number of arrestees accused of being accomplices now matches the number of escapees who have been captured.  Kendell Myles, Robert Moody, Dkenan Dennis, Gary Price and Corey Boyd are back behind bars.  As of midday Friday, five other escapees remain at large:  “Those who choose to assist or conceal these individuals are violating the law and will be held accountable. Harboring fugitives threatens the safety of our communities and will not be tolerated,” the state police said.  This controversial technology is helping to find the escaped New Orleans inmates  Williams, the maintenance worker, is accused of “willfully and maliciously” assisting with the jailbreak, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. He faces one count of malfeasance in office and 10 counts of being a principal to simple escape.  In an interview with Fox News, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill suggested Williams’ involvement extended beyond the night of the escape. “We think that it was more than just that night,” she said. “I can’t really give all the details of times and dates, but we believe this person had multiple days of involvement.”  Authorities allege Williams played a key role in the breakout by turning off the water to the toilet near where the inmates escaped. Williams said inmate Antoine Massey – one of the inmates still at large – threatened to shank him if he didn’t turn off the water, according to the affidavit.  Williams’ attorney, Michael Kennedy, said the worker was turning off water to an overflowing toilet after being told to do so and he is “fully convinced” of his client’s innocence.  The Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections is deploying at least 10 seasoned auditors to the Orleans Justice Center this week to investigate the escape.  The audit will “concentrate on jail operations, such as overall jail security, jail staffing and jail policy and procedures,” Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections Secretary Gary Westcott said in a news release Tuesday.  Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry tasked the department to audit the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, to ensure they followed “conditions necessary to ensure the safe, efficient, effective and legal operation of a jail facility,” the release added.  The last audit of the facility by the department was in 2014, according to the agency.  Technology, teamwork and cash play key roles in massive manhunt for New Orleans prison escapees  Landry on Wednesday issued an executive order “mandating an immediate and aggressive response across multiple state agencies” to address the escape, which he called a “major breach.” He called for transparency and accountability in the jail facility and elsewhere in the state.  Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who oversees the jail, announced Tuesday she is suspending her reelection campaign, just hours after fielding tough questions from local leaders at a tense city council meeting.  “I am temporarily suspending my re-election campaign. I cannot spend a moment putting politics over your needs,” Hutson said in a statement posted on social media.  New Orleans sheriff halts reelection campaign as five jail escapees remain at large  Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams and Murrill on Wednesday visited Orleans Justice Center as part of the ongoing investigation into the escape.  The district attorney said Thursday that the director of the New Orleans Police Department Crime Lab visited the jail to begin a formal forensic processing of the scene, which he said the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office had not requested.  Williams formally asked the sheriff’s office to voluntarily cooperate with the forensic analysis, including by sharing any records of staff fingerprints or DNA “for the purpose of inclusion or elimination of their profiles,” according to a letter Williams sent to the sheriff’s office on Thursday that was obtained by CNN.  A separate letter from Thursday formally requests that the sheriff’s office preserve all records related to the jailbreak including surveillance video and electronic communications between staff.  “It is critically important to get all fugitives back into custody. But it is equally important that we identify and hold accountable anyone who facilitated or assisted with this historic jailbreak,” the district attorney wrote.  CNN reached out to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office for comment on the district attorney’s requests.  CNN’s Jason Morris, Hanna Park, Michelle Krupa and Cindy Von Quednow contributed to this reporting."

"A lens on poverty and the environment: Sebastiao Salgado is dead at age 81","Fri May 23 19:16:34 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/a-lens-on-poverty-and-the-environment-sebastiao-salgado-is-dead-at-age-81","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25143582839818-1748020922.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","Known for sweeping black-and-white photography that captured the natural world and marginalised communities, Brazilian photographer Sebastiao Salgado has passed away at age 81.  His death was confirmed on Friday by the nonprofit he and his wife Lelia Deluiz Wanick Salgado founded, the Instituto Terra.  “It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of Sebastiao Salgado, our founder, mentor and eternal source of inspiration,” the institute wrote in a statement.  “Sebastiao was much more than one of the greatest photographers of our time. Alongside his life partner, Lelia Deluiz Wanick Salgado, he sowed hope where there was devastation and brought to life the belief that environmental restoration is also a profound act of love for humanity.  “His lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, the power of transformative action.”  Salgado’s upbringing would prove to be the inspiration for some of his work. Born in 1944 in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, he saw one of the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems, the Atlantic Forest, recede from the land he grew up on, as the result of development.  He and his wife spent part of the last decades of their life working to restore the forest and protect it from further threats.  But Salgado was best known for his epic photography, which captured the exploitation of both the environment and people. His pictures were marked by their depth and texture, each black-and-white frame a multilayered world of tension and struggle.  In one recent photography collection, entitled Exodus, he portrayed populations across the world taking on migrations big and small. One shot showed a crowded boat packed with migrants and asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Another showed refugees in Zaire balancing buckets and jugs above their heads, as they trekked to retrieve water for their camp.  Salgado himself was no stranger to fleeing hardship. A trained economist, he and his wife left Brazil in 1969, near the start of a nearly two-decade-long military dictatorship.  By 1973, he had begun to dedicate himself to photography full time. After working several years with France-based photography agencies, he joined the cooperative Magnum Photos, where he would become one of its most celebrated artists.  His work would draw him back to Brazil in the late 1980s, where he would embark on one of his most famous projects: photographing the backbreaking conditions at the Serra Pelada gold mine, near the mouth of the Amazon River.  Through his lens, global audiences saw thousands of men climbing rickety wooden ladders out of the crater they were carving. Sweat made their clothes cling to their skin. Heavy bundles were slung over their backs. And the mountainside around them was jagged with the ridges they had chipped away at.  “He had shot the story in his own time, spending his own money,” his agent Neil Burgess wrote in the British Journal of Photography.  Burgess explained that Salgado “spent around four weeks living and working alongside the mass of humanity that had flooded in, hoping to strike it rich” at the gold mine.  “Salgado had used a complex palette of techniques and approaches: landscape, portraiture, still life, decisive moments and general views,” Burgess said in his essay.  “He had captured images in the midst of violence and danger, and others at sensitive moments of quiet and reflection. It was a romantic, narrative work that engaged with its immediacy, but had not a drop of sentimentality. It was astonishing, an epic poem in photographic form.”  When photos from the series were published in The Sunday Times Magazine, Burgess said the reaction was so great that his phone would not stop ringing.  Critics, however, accused Salgado during his career of glamourising poverty, with some calling his style an “aesthetic of misery”.  But Salgado pushed back on that assessment in a 2024 interview with The Guardian. “Why should the poor world be uglier than the rich world? The light here is the same as there. The dignity here is the same as there.”  In 2014, one of his sons, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado, partnered with the German filmmaker Wim Wenders to film a documentary about Salgado’s life, called The Salt of the Earth.  One of his last major photography collections was Amazonia, which captured the Amazon rainforest and its people. While some viewers criticised his depiction of Indigenous peoples in the series, Salgado defended his work as a vision of the region’s vitality.  “To show this pristine place, I photograph Amazonia alive, not the dead Amazonia,” he told The Guardian in 2021, after the collection’s release.  As news of Salgado’s death spread on Friday, artists and public figures offered their remembrances of the photographer and his work. Among the mourners was Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president, who offered a tribute on social media.  “His discontent with the fact that the world is so unequal and his obstinate talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,” Lula wrote.  “Salgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: He also used the fullness of his soul and his heart. For this very reason, his work will continue to be a cry for solidarity. And a reminder that we are all equal in our diversity.”"
"Ukraine, Russia exchange hundreds of soldiers, civilians in prisoner swap","Fri May 23 17:24:30 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/ukraine-russia-exchange-hundreds-of-soldiers-civilians-in-prisoner-swap","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25143590197839-1748019144.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","Russia and Ukraine say that they have swapped hundreds of prisoners in the first phase of a major exchange that was agreed at recent direct talks in Turkiye.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that the release of 390 people by each side was the first stage of a “1,000-for-1,000” swap.  “We are bringing our people home,” he said in a social media post.  “Today – 390 people. On Saturday and Sunday, we expect the exchange to continue. Thank you to everyone who is helping and working 24/7 to bring Ukrainian men and women back home. It is very important to return everyone who remains in captivity. We are verifying every surname, every detail about each person,” he added.  Russia’s Ministry of Defence said each side had released 270 military personnel and 120 civilian detainees, with further exchanges planned “in coming days”.  In Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, crowds of cheering relatives greeted buses carrying the released Ukrainians as they arrived at a medical facility.  “I didn’t believe until this moment that it could happen,” said 38-year-old Oleksandr Tarasov, from Mykolaiv, who was captured a year and nine months ago on the Kherson front after its recapture by Ukraine in 2022. “I’m just happy I made it back … I just want to speak to my loved ones,” he said.  Others continue to search for information about loved ones who remain missing. Some of the released men paused to look at pictures of missing loved ones held by members of the crowd, with one serviceman saying that he had shared a cell with one of the individuals featured in a picture.  “It’s extremely hard to go to sleep every night not knowing what happened to him,” said 49-year-old Svitlana Kuskova, holding a sign with a photo of her husband, Oleksandr Kuskov, who has been missing for the past year.  The Russian Ministry of Defence said that released Russian detainees, who include civilians captured during a Ukrainian incursion into the region of Kursk, were taken to Belarus for medical treatment.  United States President Donald Trump, who has pushed each side to hold talks to end the war, welcomed the exchange in a social media post, adding it could “lead to something big”.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later said that Russia will have a draft of conditions necessary for an agreement to end the war by the time the exchanges are completed.  But uncertainty remains over the path towards a negotiated settlement to end the war, or even a pause in the fighting, more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Istanbul last week were the first direct talks the two sides have held since the early weeks of the war, but lasted for only two hours and did not produce an agreement on a cessation of hostilities.  Ukraine has stated it would accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire, while Russia has said it will not do so unless certain conditions are met."
"‘No soldiers, no occupation’: Israel’s anti-war protests small, but growing","Fri May 23 17:15:00 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/no-soldiers-no-occupation-israels-anti-war-protests-small-but-growing","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AFP__20250517__474T73N__v1__HighRes__IsraelPalestinianConflictHostages-1747541841.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","“One of the guards came up to me and asked if I was there to save Gaza’s children, then he punched me in the stomach,” Alon-Lee Green said, recounting his experience in an Israeli prison this week.  Green and eight others were arrested on Sunday for protesting with about 600 others along Israel’s border with Gaza, spending two nights and almost three days in prison before being placed under house arrest. Together, they represent part of a small but increasingly visible groundswell of resistance in Israel to a war that, for a variety of reasons, many Israelis are turning their backs on.  “Some people are protesting because they see it as a political war,” Green, who also serves as national co-director of the activist group Standing Together, said of the growing sense in Israel that the war on Gaza only serves to sustain Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition.  “Some are tired of fighting, some want the hostages [to be released from Gaza] , and some [are protesting against] what we’re doing to Palestinians. All are welcome,” he continued. “You want to resist the government? You’re welcome. You don’t want to enlist? You’re welcome. You supported the war until just recently? You’re welcome.”  Polls in Israel show that the majority now favour a deal that would secure the release of the captives held in Gaza, even if that means an end to the war on Gaza. Nevertheless, the war has continued.  “I don’t know if popular pressure’s going to ever stop the war,” said Green. “I mean, its supporters have been in a minority for a year. Refusing [to answer the call up] is our most powerful weapon: no soldiers, no occupation. We need more and more people to refuse.”  All the antiwar activists Al Jazeera spoke to talked of an uptick in interest in their movement following the Israeli government’s unilateral decision in mid-March to collapse the ceasefire it had previously agreed to after months of negotiation.  Others spoke of a dramatic increase in support when, after 11 weeks of unremitting siege on Gaza, Israel announced its latest mass ground operation in the devastated Palestinian territory on May 17, intended, according to one Israeli official, to lead to “the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories”.  Before its latest offensive, Israel called up what it said were “tens of thousands” of reservists to bolster its numbers in Gaza.  Speaking after the announcement of the latest military attack on Gaza, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was clear in what he saw as the aims of the offensive, saying that, within months, Gaza would be “totally destroyed” and what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million would be exiled to a narrow strip of land along the Egyptian border.  However, despite the new offensive to recapture ground already largely destroyed by the Israeli military, dissent is gaining ground.  Open letters protesting the war from military units and reservists publicly refusing to turn up for service are becoming more frequent. In April, more than a thousand of Israel’s current and former pilots, generally regarded as an elite unit, wrote an open letter protesting a war they said served the “political and personal interests” of Netanyahu, “and not security ones”.  There are no official numbers for how many reservists have not turned up for duty. But, according to Israeli media reports, the number may be as high as 100,000. Those numbers are in addition to those refusing their initial period of mandatory military service.  Most of those are “grey” refusals, activists say. That is, people who gave no political reason for refusing to serve, officially refusing for other reasons, such as declining on medical grounds.  But Sofia Orr, a 19-year-old from Pardes Hannah in northern Israel, is one of a growing number of conscripts refusing their mandatory service and making that refusal as public as possible.  Orr refused to serve three times after first being called up on February 24, 2024. Her first and second refusals each netted her 20 days in military prison. Her third cost her 45 days.  “I’d already decided to refuse when I was 15,” Orr told Al Jazeera. “I asked myself, ‘If I go and serve in the military, what cause am I serving, does it align with my values, who am I actually helping?’” she said.  “If I enlist, am I just entering the cycle of bloodshed that occupies and bloodily oppresses Palestinians daily?” she said of defying what she described as hardwired societal expectations of Israeli life.  “I wanted to challenge that, so it wasn’t just about refusing, but doing so as publicly and loudly as possible. I needed people to see it and know that we exist, that they could do the same, to bring Palestinian suffering into Israeli society and for Palestinians to see it and know they were not alone,” she said.        Orr is a member of “Mesarvot”, an Israeli organisation that has been supporting conscientious objectors in the face of calls from prominent politicians for refusers to be arrested and prosecuted, including from cabinet member and former Israeli military spokesperson Miri Regev.  “There’s been a steady growth of refusers since October 7,” Nimrod Flaschenberg, a political analyst and spokesperson for Mesarvot said, referring to the 2023 attack on southern Israel that led to Israel’s war on Gaza. “But we’ve been seeing an exponential increase of 16-, 17-year-olds refusing to serve recently. There are around a hundred circulating an open letter, all refusing service and explaining why.”  Of the wider movement, Flaschenberg said, some refused to serve in a war they had come to regard as political, others because they felt it risked the lives of the captives and a minority out of revulsion for the mass killing in Gaza and the West Bank that they were being asked to participate in.  “There’s still an Israeli public taboo over showing any public sympathy for Palestinians,” Flaschenberg said of the low prominence given to Gaza in the reasons given by most refusers, contrasting that with the widespread outrage that greeted ex-General and leader of Israel’s Democrats party, Yair Golan, because he warned that Israel risked becoming regarded as a “pariah state” that killed Palestinian babies “as a hobby” if it didn’t “return to sanity”.  “That really demonstrates the level of ignorance we’re talking about,” Flaschenberg said. “Of course, Israel is killing babies, but Israelis just can’t accept that.”  However, while growing international condemnation of Israel concentrates on vilifying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to Orr, it risks overlooking a harsher reality.  “For many people here, it’s Israelis who are the real victims, the first, the last and only victims in all of this,” she said. “They don’t even see Palestinians as people, just as a threat.”  Green, who immediately rejoined the protest on the Gaza border after his overnight release from house arrest was over, was equally fatalistic.  “I’m not confident we’ll succeed. The government has represented a minority of Israelis for around a year, and the war’s continued,” he said.  But, despite that, he was not ready to give up on calling for Israelis to wake up.  “Things are already bad enough,” Green added. “We’ve destroyed nearly every building in Gaza, we’ve killed 18,000 babies, and about 53,000 people. This is something we’re going to have to live with.”  “Do we really want to live with any more?”"
"US judge blocks Trump effort to bar Harvard from enrolling foreign students","Fri May 23 16:35:37 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/blatant-violation-harvard-sues-trump-over-move-to-block-foreign-students","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-04-15T233353Z_797009637_RC2IYDAYUSGO_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-UNIVERSITIES-1748009711.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","A United States judge has issued a temporary restraining order against an effort to prevent Harvard University from enrolling foreign students.  Friday’s ruling comes in response to an emergency petition filed earlier in the day in the federal district court of Boston, Massachusetts.  In that petition, Harvard sought immediate relief after the administration of President Donald Trump barred it from using a federal government system, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, that is required for the enrolment of international students.  US District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard that the school and its students may suffer harm if the Trump administration’s decision is allowed to take effect. Her injunction is set to last for approximately two weeks, and she set hearing dates on May 27 and 29.  Friday’s lawsuit against the Trump administration is Harvard’s second in less than two months.  The latest is a response to a decision on Thursday announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Her department oversees the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and she said she is revoking Harvard’s privilege to use the system based on its failure to address Trump administration concerns.  “This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” she wrote on social media.  The revocation means that Harvard can no longer accept foreign students. Those already enrolled will need to transfer to another school.  The move represents a major escalation in Trump’s pressure campaign against Harvard and other top US universities. He has accused schools of allowing anti-Semitism to fester, promoting “discriminatory” diversity programmes, and pushing ideological slants.  But in Friday’s lawsuit, Harvard called the Trump administration’s actions a “blatant violation” of the US Constitution and other federal laws.  Barring the prestigious Ivy League school from enrolling its international students would have an “immediate and devastating effect” on the university and the more than 7,000 visa holders in its student body, it argued.  “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” the complaint said. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.”  Trump’s current battle against higher education can be largely traced back to the pro-Palestine protests that broke out on US campuses last year, in response to Israel’s war in Gaza. Trump made cracking down on the antiwar protests a centrepiece of his 2024 re-election campaign.  While there have been instances of harassment from participants on both sides of the issue, protest organisers have rejected claims of widespread anti-Jewish sentiment. Some campus protests have even been spearheaded by Jewish students and organisations, including Jewish Voice for Peace.  Earlier this year, task forces at Harvard itself issued two reports, warning about instances of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, as well as anti-Semitism.        Harvard has said it is working to address these concerns. Nevertheless, in April, Harvard became the latest school to receive a list of demands from the Trump administration.  The list included reforming its hiring and admissions practices, refusing to admit students deemed “hostile to the American values and institutions”, doing away with diversity programmes, and auditing academic programmes and centres, including several related to the Middle East.  Harvard rejected the demands and immediately faced a freeze in $2.2bn in multi-year grants and $60m in multi-year contracts. Several federal agencies have since frozen tens of millions of dollars more in grants to Harvard.  The university responded to Trump’s funding freezes with a lawsuit in April, saying the administration was violating the First Amendment of the US Constitution with its “arbitrary and capricious” cuts.  Trump has also floated revoking Harvard’s tax exempt status, and in April, Noem sent a letter to Harvard first threatening to revoke its Student and Exchange Visitor Program approval if administrators did not send information on any foreign students’ “illegal and violent activities”.  At the end of April, Harvard said it had provided all legally required information, without providing further details.  Friday’s lawsuit seeks immediate relief from the Trump administration’s decision to de-certify Harvard’s ability to register foreign students, citing “irreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action”.  In response to the complaint, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused the school of doing too little to address the Trump administration’s concerns.  “If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus, they wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with,” Jackson said.  “Harvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,” she added.  In a letter to the Harvard community, school President Alan Garber framed Trump’s attack on Harvard’s foreign student body as part of “a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence”.  Garber described the de-certification as evidence of the “federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body”.        In its complaint, Harvard said the de-certification has thrown “countless” academic programmes, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray.  Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 percent of its total enrolment.  On Thursday, Noem also said Harvard could avoid the move if it turned over more information on foreign students, including video or audio of their protest activity over the past five years.  Harvard has maintained it has already met the legal requirements in its disclosures."
"Trump threatens 50% tariffs on EU, 25% on Apple, ratcheting up trade war","Fri May 23 16:03:56 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/23/trump-threatens-50-tariffs-on-eu-25-on-apple-ratcheting-up-trade-war","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AFP__20250523__47TQ2YU__v1__HighRes__UsPoliticsTrump-1748012273.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","US President Donald Trump has threatened a 50-percent tariff on all imports from the European Union and 25-percent on Apple products unless iPhones are made in the United States.  The president announced his intentions over social media on Friday.  “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.”  The Republican president’s proposal would see higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30 percent this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations.  Trump has been upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10-percent tax on most imports.  Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher.        “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”  Trump’s post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.  “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”  The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.  Later on Friday, Trump told reporters inside the Oval Office that his proposed tariff on Apple would also apply to “Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” apparently referring to smartphones.  He also said he expected the new phone levy to be in place by the end of June.        In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the US during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, analysts estimated that the cost for a $1,200 iPhone, if made in America, could jump anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.  “The pressure from Trump administration on Apple to build iPhone production in the US … would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of ~$3,500 which is not realistic as this would take 5-10 years to shift production to the US. We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note.  Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25-percent import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.  Until recently, the US president repeatedly bragged about the $500bn that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.  “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him, ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500bn, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’”  German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market”.  “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”  Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he expected a calm and robust response from the EU to the announcement of possible new US trade tariffs.  In response to the news, Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said the tariffs would result in higher prices for consumers. In an interview with the Reuters news agency, he said the tariff would limit the ability of Volvo Cars to sell its Belgium-made EX30 electric vehicle in the US.  Investors are shaken on the move. As of 10:30am in New York (14:30 GMT), the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1 percent and the S&P 500 was down 0.8 percent. Apple is down 2.3 percent from the market close yesterday.  SAP, Europe’s most valuable company’s stock, is down 1.8 percent from yesterday’s close. Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical giant and the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, which is Europe’s second-highest valued company, has seen its stock down 1 percent on the news.  Shares in LVMH and Hermes, France’s largest listed companies by market capitalisation, fell by about 3 and 4 percent, respectively."
"Pakistan, Afghanistan move towards ‘restoring ties’ in talks with China","Fri May 23 15:28:07 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/pakistan-afghanistan-move-towards-restoring-ties-in-talks-with-china","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/W020250521708084201410-1748006712.png?resize=1200%2C675","Islamabad, Pakistan – As Pakistan remained embroiled in a war of words with its archrival India – following a dramatic exchange of missiles and drones nearly two weeks ago – it this week advanced diplomatic efforts with two other neighbors: China and Afghanistan, which could lead to the formal resumption of diplomatic ties between Islamabad and Kabul after nearly four years.  In an “informal” trilateral meeting held in Beijing on May 21, the foreign ministers of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan convened under a forum first launched in 2017, and which last met in May 2023.  This time, a key outcome from the meeting, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was a renewed willingness by both Pakistan and Afghanistan to restore diplomatic relations after heightened tensions in recent years.  “Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible. China welcomed this and will continue to provideassistance for the improvement of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations,” Wang said.  He added that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a $62bn mega project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – will now be extended into Afghanistan.  A Pakistani diplomat with direct knowledge of the talks told Al Jazeera that the next round of the trilateral meetings will be held “very soon”, within a few weeks, to build on the momentum from the Beijing conclave.  “I am reasonably optimistic about the outcomes. It was a great confidence- and trust-building exercise between the three countries,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity about the Beijing meeting.  The meeting came after a four-day standoff between Pakistan and India, with both countries claiming “victory” and launching diplomatic offensives to assert dominance.  The conflict, from May 7 to May 10, followed Indian strikes on what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan, in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last month that left 26 civilians dead. India blamed the attack on Pakistan-based armed groups, an allegation Islamabad denies.  While China urged restraint on both sides, its support for Pakistan was evident on the front lines of the conflict, with the Pakistani military using Chinese fighter jets, missiles, and air defence systems.  On the other hand, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on May 15 that he appreciated Afghan acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s “condemnation” of the Pahalgam attack, in a conversation between the two. Indian media also reported a visit to New Delhi by senior Taliban figure and deputy interior minister, Ibrahim Sadr, in early May.  Mustafa Hyder Sayed, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan-China Institute, called the Beijing meeting “very significant”, given Afghanistan’s geopolitical sensitivity.  For Pakistan and China, the “conflict with India has reinforced strategic clarity” on the need to work closely with Afghanistan, Sayed said.  Kabul-based political analyst Tameem Bahiss agreed.  “This [the call between Muttaqi and Jaishankar] signals a major shift in India-Afghanistan relations, one that could raise concerns in Islamabad amid an already volatile regional climate,” he said. “The timing of this trilateral meeting, not just its content, reflects an urgent need for coordination among these three countries as new geopolitical dynamics take shape in South and Central Asia.”  Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar @MIshaqDar50, Member of the CPC Political Bureau & Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Yi, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Amir Khan Muttaqi, held an informal trilateral meeting in… pic.twitter.com/xbVcmUDijD  — Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Pakistan (@ForeignOfficePk) May 21, 2025    When the Afghan Taliban returned to power in August 2021, many saw it as a win for Pakistan, given its historical ties to the group. From 1996 through 2021, Pakistan was one of the Taliban’s key allies. India, meanwhile, viewed the Taliban as a proxy of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies and refused to engage with it.  However, relations between Pakistan and the Taliban have deteriorated.  Pakistan has accused the Afghan Taliban of allowing groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to launch attacks across the border, an allegation the Taliban vehemently deny. The TTP, formed in 2007, shares ideological roots with the Afghan Taliban but operates independently.  According to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, Pakistan suffered 521 attacks in 2024 – a 70 percent increase from the previous year – resulting in nearly 1,000 civilian and security personnel deaths.  But in a trip that was seen as a potential breakthrough in strained ties, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul on April 19, just days before the Pahalgam attack.  Ihsanullah Tipu, an Islamabad-based security analyst, says Pakistan’s renewed diplomatic outreach to Afghanistan prioritises key concerns, with security taking precedence over trade, border disputes, and border closures, a sentiment he said China also shares.  “To foster meaningful trade ties, Pakistan’s security concerns must be addressed first,” Tipu told Al Jazeera, warning that failure to do so could escalate tensions to armed conflict.  “But given China’s global influence and close ties with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, Beijing can play a pivotal role as a guarantor of any commitments made,” added Tipu, who co-founded the security research portal The Khorasan Diary.  While Pakistan continues to accuse the Afghan Taliban of harbouring fighters who attack targets in Pakistan, many of these assaults have been directed at Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects.  Pakistani government figures estimate that about 20,000 Chinese nationals live in the country. At least 20 have been killed in attacks since 2021 in provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Groups including the TTP have claimed responsibility.  China has also expressed concern over the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), alleging that its fighters use Afghan territory to stage attacks against China.  Sayed of PCI stressed that both Pakistan and China see security as their “core interest” in Afghanistan.  “This is a shared threat, and in the past the ETIM has also had a significance presence in Afghanistan. And these militant networks are connected with each other as well. So that is a pre-requisite for any cooperation to move forward, to first neutralise these terrorist outfits, which seem to be operating freely and comfortably in Afghanistan,” he said.  However, Bahiss noted that since the Taliban’s return to power, most regional countries, including China, have found the security situation inside Afghanistan acceptable, enabling ongoing economic engagement.  “The key exception is Pakistan, which continues to face serious threats from Afghan soil. While Pakistan prioritises eliminating or containing the TTP, Kabul is focused on trade, transit, and regional integration,” he said.  This is where China’s pivotal role could come into the picture, the Kabul-based analyst said, adding that the country is uniquely positioned to mediate by encouraging security cooperation while also advancing trade and transit initiatives that benefit all three countries.  During the civilian governments in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, India and Afghanistan developed close ties, despite several attacks on Indian diplomatic missions by the Taliban and its allies.  In recent months, there has been increased interaction between officials from New Delhi and Kabul, including the recent Jaishankar-Muttaqi conversation.  Does this warming of ties raise alarm in Islamabad? Sayed doesn’t think so.  “Pakistan doesn’t mistrust Kabul. But Pakistan has asked for action. The rulers there need to walk the talk regarding TTP and other terrorist outfits. I don’t think either Beijing or Islamabad opposes Kabul having positive relations with India, as long as it doesn’t compromise the interests of Pakistan and China,” he said.  However, Bahis said New Delhi’s rapprochement with the Taliban could lead to worries in Pakistan and China, both of which have historically had tense ties with India.  “While recent India-Afghanistan contacts are still in early stages, their timing may raise concerns in Islamabad,” he said.  “Afghanistan has the sovereign right to engage with any country, including India. But it must tread carefully. Clear messaging is essential to ensure that its growing ties with New Delhi aren’t misinterpreted as threats by other regional players,” Bahiss said. “Balancing these complex relationships will require diplomacy, transparency, and mutual respect.”"
"‘Tortured’ Ugandan activist dumped at border following arrest in Tanzania","Fri May 23 11:44:15 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/tortured-ugandan-activist-dumped-at-border-following-arrest-in-tanzania","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/12074364-1747991819.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","A Ugandan human rights activist, arrested in Tanzania after travelling to the country to support an opposition politician at a trial for treason, has been tortured and dumped at the border, according to an NGO.  Ugandan rights group Agora Discourse said on Friday that activist and journalist Agather Atuhaire had been “abandoned at the border by Tanzanian authorities” and showed signs of torture.          The statement echoes reports regarding a Kenyan activist detained at the same time and released a day earlier, and supports complaints of a crackdown on democracy across East Africa.  Atuhaire had travelled to Tanzania alongside Kenyan anticorruption campaigner Boniface Mwangi to support opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who appeared in court on Monday.  Both were arrested shortly after the hearing and held incommunicado.  Tanzanian police had initially told local rights groups that the pair would be deported by air. However, Mwangi was discovered on Thursday on a roadside in northern Tanzania near the Kenyan border.  Agora Discourse said it was “relieved to inform the public that Agather has been found”. However, the rights group’s cofounder Jim Spire Ssentongo confirmed to the AFP news agency on Friday that there were “indications of torture”.  Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been accused of increasing authoritarianism, amid rising concerns regarding democracy across East Africa.  Activists travelling to Lissu’s trail accused Tanzania of “collaborating” with Kenya and Uganda in their “total erosion of democratic principles”.  Several high-profile political arrests have highlighted the rights record of Hassan, who plans to seek re-election in October.  The Tanzanian leader has said that her government is committed to respecting human rights. However, she warned earlier this week that foreign activists would not be tolerated in the country as Lissu appeared in court.  “Do not allow ill-mannered individuals from other countries to cross the line here,” Hassan instructed security services.  Several activists from Kenya, including a former justice minister, said they were denied entry to Tanzania as they tried to travel to attend the trial.  Following his return to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, Mwangi said that he and Atuhaire had suffered a brutal experience.  “We were both treated worse than dogs, chained, blindfolded and underwent a very gruesome torture,” he told reporters.  “The Government of Tanzania cannot hide behind national sovereignty to justify committing serious crimes and human rights violations against its own citizens and other East Africans,” the International Commission of Jurists in Kenya said in a statement."
"‘Red lines’ stalk fifth round of Iran-US nuclear talks","Fri May 23 08:33:13 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/red-lines-stalk-fifth-round-of-iran-us-nuclear-talks","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AFP__20250409__39MG7QT__v1__HighRes__FilesComboOmanUsIranDiplomacyNuclear-1745047172_9e3436-1745048040.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","Negotiators for Iran and the United States have concluded a fifth round of talks, as mediator Oman said there was some limited progress in negotiations aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme.  “The fifth round of Iran-US talks have concluded today in Rome with some, but not conclusive, progress,” said Omani mediator Badr al-Busaidi after Friday’s meeting at the Omani embassy in Rome’s Camilluccia neighbourhood.  “We hope to clarify the remaining issues in the coming days,” he said after the high-level talks, which were led by Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.  Araghchi told Iranian state television that the talks had been “one of the most professional rounds of negotiations” so far, noting that, while an agreement had not been reached, the Iranian side was “not discouraged”.  “We firmly stated Iran’s position … The fact that we are now on a reasonable path, in my view, is itself a sign of progress,” Araghchi told Press TV.  “The proposals and solutions will be reviewed in respective capitals … and the next round of talks will be scheduled accordingly.”  Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said earlier that chief US negotiator Steve Witkoff had left the negotiations early “due to his flight schedule”, but that they had continued in a “sane and calm atmosphere”.  The ongoing talks seek a new deal in which Iran would be prevented from producing nuclear weapons while having international sanctions eased.  However, little progress has been made so far, and both Washington and Tehran have taken a tough stance in public in recent days, particularly regarding Iran’s enrichment of uranium.  Witkoff has said Iran cannot be allowed to carry out any enrichment.  Tehran, which has raised its enrichment to about 60 percent, well above civilian needs but below the 90 percent needed for weaponisation, has rejected that “red line”.  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the demand “excessive and outrageous“, warning that the ongoing talks are unlikely to yield results.  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday that Washington is working to reach an agreement that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy programme, but not enrich uranium, while admitting that achieving such a deal “will not be easy”.  On Thursday, the Department of State announced new sanctions on Iran’s construction sector.        “Figuring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,” Araghchi said on social media on Friday morning. “Zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. Time to decide.”  A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran took aim at the new sanctions, calling the move “vicious, illegal, and inhumane”.  Reporting from Rome, Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic said uranium enrichment was not the only “stumbling block” in the talks. The US delegation had also wanted to broach the subject of Iran’s ballistic missile programme, which the Iranian side has insisted was a “completely separate issue to the nuclear programme”, she said.  The stakes are high for both sides. Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race.  Iran insists its nuclear ambitions are strictly civilian, but seeks to ease international sanctions that hamper its economy.  During his first term, in 2018, Trump nixed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a 2015 agreement that saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for eased sanctions.  After his return to the White House for a second term in January, Trump renewed his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, piling further economic pressure, for example, by choking the country’s oil exports, particularly to China.  Iran responded defiantly, promising to defend itself against any attack and escalating enrichment far beyond the 2015 pact’s limits.  Tensions began to ease in April as the two countries entered into the indirect talks, but Tehran’s enrichment programme has become a key point of contention.  Trump has raised the threat of US military action if no agreement is reached. Israel, which opposes the US talks with its regional foe, has warned that it would never allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. Following reports that Israel may be planning to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, Araghchi said that the United States would bear legal responsibility if Iran is attacked.  Hamid Reza Gholamzade, director of think tank The House of Diplomacy, told Al Jazeera that threats of military action were just a “stick” to “bully” Iran into negotiations.  “Iran knows that the threat is not real, and if there is any attack, Iran would respond strongly to that. The reality is that if they could have damaged the Iranian facilities, they [would] have done it long ago,“ he said, speaking from Tehran.  The US, he said, did not want a “fully fledged war in the region”. “They know that if there is a war, if there is an attack, it would be necessarily dragging Americans into [a] long war here”."
"EU membership, seizing Russia’s money needed to rebuild Ukraine: Analysts","Fri May 23 06:42:56 EEST 2025","Al Jazeera English","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/23/eu-membership-seizing-russias-money-needed-to-rebuild-ukraine-analysts","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-22T081659Z_701004694_RC2CMEAK5TY2_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-POKROVSK-1747942312.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","Ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine may soon be under way, but Ukraine’s economic recovery will be hobbled unless the European Union fast-tracks the war-torn country’s membership and provides hundreds of billions of euros’ worth of insurance and investment, experts tell Al Jazeera.  “I think what Ukraine needs is some kind of future where it will have a stable and defendable border, and that will only come, I would think, with EU membership,” historian Phillips O’Brien told Al Jazeera.  The US administration of President Donald Trump last month handed Ukraine and Russia a ceasefire proposal that excluded future NATO membership of Ukraine, satisfying a key Kremlin demand and leaving Ukraine without the security guarantees it seeks.  “What business is actually going to take the risk of getting involved there economically?” asked O’Brien. “With NATO off the table, I think if Ukraine is going to have a chance of rebuilding and being integrated into Europe, it will have to be through a fast-tracked EU membership.”  That membership is by no means assured, although the European Commission started negotiations in record time last June, and Ukraine has the support of EU heavyweights like France and Germany.  If Ukraine becomes an EU member, it would still face a devastated economy requiring vast investment.  The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) estimated that between Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 and November last year, Moscow’s onslaught had destroyed $170bn of infrastructure, with the housing, transport and energy sectors most affected.  That figure did not include the damage incurred in almost a decade of war in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk since 2014 or the loss of 29 percent of Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) from the invasion in 2022. The estimate also did not put a value on the loss of almost a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, which Russia now occupies.  That territory contains almost half of Ukraine’s unexploited mineral wealth, worth an estimated $12.4 trillion, according to SecDev, a Canadian geopolitical risk firm.  It also does not include some types of reconstruction costs, such as chemical decontamination and mine-clearing.  The World Bank put the cost of infrastructure damages slightly higher this year, at $176bn, and predicts the cost of reconstruction and recovery at about $525bn over 10 years.  Economic war has been part of Russia’s strategy since the invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014, argued Maximilian Hess, a risk analyst and Eurasia expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.  “The Kremlin has certainly looted occupied territory, including for coking coal, agricultural products, and iron,” Hess told Al Jazeera.  The KSE has estimated Russia stole half a million tonnes of grain, included in the $1.9bn damages bill to the agricultural sector.  Using long-range rocketry, Russia also targeted industrial hubs not under its control.  Ukraine inherited a series of factories from the Soviet Union, including the Kharkiv Tractor Plant, the Zaporizhia Automobile Plant, the Pivdenmash rocket manufacturer in Dnipro and massive steel plants.  “All were targeted by Russian forces,” wrote Hess in his recent book, Economic War. “Russia’s attacks were, of course, primarily aimed at devastating the Ukrainian economy and weakening its ability and will to fight, but they also raised the cost to the West of supporting Ukraine in the conflict, something the Kremlin hoped would lead to reduced support for Kyiv.”        Through occupation and targeting, Russia managed to deprive Ukraine of a flourishing metallurgy sector.  According to the United States Geological Survey, metallurgical production decreased by 66.5 percent as a result of the war.  That is a vast loss, considering that Ukraine once produced almost a third of the iron ore in Europe, Russia and Central Eurasia, half of the region’s manganese ore and a third of its titanium. It remains the only producer of uranium in Europe, an important resource in the continent’s quest for greater energy autonomy.  Ukraine’s claims to have built a $20bn defence industrial base with allied help, a rare wartime economic success story.  That can make up for the losses in metallurgy, Hess said, “but only in part and in different regions of the country from which those mining and metallurgical ones were concentrated. Boosting [metallurgical activities] in places like Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and ideally territory ultimately freed from Russian occupation, will be necessary to win the peace.”  Weeks ago, Ukraine and the US signed a memorandum of intent to jointly exploit Ukraine’s mineral wealth.  Ukraine committed to putting half the proceeds from its metallurgical activities into a Reconstruction Fund, but experts doubted the notion that mineral wealth can rebuild Ukraine.  “Projects have a long launch period … from five to 10 years,” Maxim Fedoseienko, head of strategic projects at the KSE Institute, told Al Jazeera. “You need to make documentation, environmental impacts assessment, and after that, you can also need three years to build this mine.”  The US and EU might invest in such mines, Fedoseienko said, because “we have more than 24 kinds of materials from the EU list of critical [raw] materials,” but they would only contribute to the Ukrainian economy if investments were equitable.  Trump presented the minerals deal as payback for billions in military aid.  “There’s nothing remotely fair about it. The aid was not given to be paid back,” said O’Brien.  As Fedoseienko put it, “It is not fair if everyone will say, ‘OK, we will help you in a time of war, so you are owned [by] us.’”  In addition to fairness, Ukraine needs money. Some of that needs to come in the form of insurance.  A state-backed war-risk insurance formula Kyiv reached with the United Kingdom in 2023, for example, brought bulk carriers back to Ukraine’s ports and defeated Russian efforts to blockade Ukrainian grain exports.  As a result, Ukraine exported 57.5 million tonnes of agricultural goods in 2023-2024, and was on track to export 77 million tonnes in the 2024-2025 marketing year, which ends in June, its agriculture ministry said.  “There needs to be a substantial expansion of public insurance products in particular, as well as a move to seize frozen Russian assets,” said Hess.  Seizing some $300bn in Russian central bank money held in the EU was deemed controversial, but the measure is now receiving support.  “The Russian state has committed these war crimes, has broken international law, has done this damage to Ukraine – that actually becomes a just way of helping Ukraine rebuild,” said O’Brien. “[Europeans] have a very strong case for this, but they, right now, lack the political will to do it.”  Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has already repeatedly asked Europe to use the money for Ukraine’s defence and reconstruction.  What Europeans have done in the meantime is going some way towards rebuilding Ukraine.  Some $300m in interest payments proceeding from Russian assets are diverted to reconstruction each year.  A European Commission programme provides 9.3 billion euros ($10.5bn) of financial support designed to leverage investment from the private sector.  Financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank are providing loan guarantees to Ukrainian banks, which gives them liquidity.  “So Ukrainian banks can provide loans to Ukrainian companies to invest and operate in Ukraine. This is a big ecosystem to finance investment and operational needs to the Ukrainian economy,” said Fedoseienko.  Together with the finance ministry, the KSE operates an online portal providing information about the various instruments available, which has already helped bring 165 investments to fruition worth $27bn.  “Is it enough to recover the Ukrainian economy?” Fedoseienko asked. “No, but this is a significant programme to support Ukraine now.”"
